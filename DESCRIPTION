Description: Tools to perform linear modelling on large genetic datasets stored in plink bim/bed/fam format. For a dataset with N individuals and L SNPs, supports a selection of memory efficient approaches including Stochastic Gradient Descent at O(N+P), Sequential updating at O(P^2), using big.menory.
